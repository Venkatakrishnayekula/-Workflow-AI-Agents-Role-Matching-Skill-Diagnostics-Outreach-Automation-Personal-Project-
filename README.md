# -Workflow-AI-Agents-Role-Matching-Skill-Diagnostics-Outreach-Automation-Personal-Project-
This repository showcases an exploratory build of intelligent workflow agents designed to optimize the job search process through automation, personalization, and agentic orchestration. Inspired by real-world job targeting challenges, this system leverages AI to analyze job postings, align resume content, and automate communication tasks.

ðŸ”§ Key Capabilities
- Match user resume data to job descriptions using LLMs and prompt-based reasoning
- Identify skill gaps and surface PoC ideas for targeted learning
- Draft personalized outreach messages (email, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Track role-specific insights for curated job targeting

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python & LangChain for multi-agent orchestration
- OpenAI API for semantic parsing and response generation
- PostgreSQL for resume and job data management
- Prompt Engineering for dynamic role-to-profile logic
- GitHub Copilot & Cursor AI for accelerated prototyping
- Streamlit (optional) for UI experimentation

ðŸ’¡ Project Status
This is a personal PoC with active iterations. The focus is on building a modular and extensible foundation for future agentic enhancements in career automation and intelligent workflows.
